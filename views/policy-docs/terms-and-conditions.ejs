            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

                <li>All interactions between buyers and sellers, including negotiations and transactions, are conducted at your own risk. You acknowledge that e-autopartstore acts solely as a platform for connection and is not responsible for the outcome of any transaction.</li>
                <li>e-autopartstore reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that are found to be in violation of these terms or engaged in fraudulent, illegal, or harmful activities.</li>
                <li>You agree not to use the platform for any unlawful purposes or to distribute harmful content, including viruses or malicious software.</li>
                <li>You understand and agree that any fees associated with premium features or advertising packages on the platform are non-refundable unless specifically stated otherwise.</li>
                <li>While we strive to maintain a reliable and secure platform, there may be occasional interruptions or technical challenges. We continually work to ensure your data is protected, but we cannot provide absolute guarantees. You agree to use e-autopartstore at your discretion and responsibility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Role of e-autopartstore</h2>
            <p><strong>e-autopartstore</strong> serves as a marketplace connecting sellers and buyers of vehicle spare parts and accessories. We do not participate in, nor are we responsible for, the transactions, negotiations, or agreements made between the two parties. Buyers and sellers are solely responsible for all aspects of their dealings, including but not limited to pricing, delivery, and the authenticity of the products.</p>

            <h2>4. Posting and Listing Products</h2>
            <p>Sellers are permitted to post listings for vehicle spare parts and accessories, subject to the following terms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As a seller, you are responsible for ensuring that the details provided in your listing, including product descriptions, images, and pricing, are accurate and complete.</li>
                <li>While <strong>e-autopartstore</strong> makes every effort to verify the compatibility of the listed products, it is ultimately the responsibility of the buyer to confirm the authenticity and quality of the product before finalizing the transaction.</li>
                <li>Sellers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when posting products, including intellectual property rights and trade restrictions.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right to remove any listing that violates our policies, contains misleading information, or is otherwise deemed inappropriate.</li>
                <li>e-autopartstore offers three listing options for sellers: Free, Standard, and Premium. The selected package determines the level of visibility and exposure for your products on the platform.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Buyer Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>As a buyer, you are responsible for conducting your own research before purchasing any product. We do not guarantee the quality, legality, or suitability of products listed on our platform. Before making any payments or collecting the product, you must inspect the item to ensure it meets your expectations.</p>

            <h2>6. Monetary Transactions</h2>
            <p>All monetary transactions between buyers and sellers take place outside of the <strong>e-autopartstore</strong> platform. We do not process or facilitate payments, and we are not responsible for any issues related to payments or refunds. Buyers and sellers must agree on payment terms directly and handle all financial matters independently.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>e-autopartstore</strong> will not intervene in payment disputes or handle the exchange of funds. Buyers and sellers must independently agree on the method of payment (e.g., cash, bank transfer, mobile payments).</li>
                <li>It is the responsibility of both the buyer and seller to agree upon payment terms and any potential return or refund policies prior to finalizing the transaction.</li>
                <li>e-autopartstore recommends using secure and reliable methods of payment to minimize the risk of fraud or financial loss.</li>
                <li>All negotiations regarding the price, delivery method, and condition of the product should be conducted between the buyer and seller. e-autopartstore does not provide any form of payment protection or buyer guarantees.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Seller's Packages and Boost Options</h2>
            <p>As a seller, you have the option to promote your products using one of the following packages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free Package:</strong> A basic listing option that allows you to post products with limited visibility in search results and categories.</li>
                <li><strong>Standard Package:</strong> This option includes higher visibility in relevant searches and categories, providing more exposure for your products.</li>
                <li><strong>Premium Package:</strong> The Premium option provides maximum visibility for your product. Premium listings receive priority placement in search results and category listings, ensuring that more buyers see your product first.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note that while selecting a Premium or Standard package increases visibility, it does not guarantee sales. The quality of your product, pricing, and buyer demand are critical factors in achieving successful transactions. Fees for boost packages are non-refundable once the product is live.</p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>We are not liable for any disputes, losses, or damages resulting from transactions conducted between buyers and sellers. While we provide a platform for connection, the responsibility for the transaction rests solely with the buyer and seller.</p>

            <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. When changes are made, the revised version will be posted on this page, and your continued use of the platform will constitute your acceptance of the changes.</p>
