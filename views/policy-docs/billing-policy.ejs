      <h2>Billing Policies</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>e-autopartstore</strong>, your go-to platform for connecting buyers and sellers of vehicle parts and accessories. Our platform is designed to serve as a bridge, bringing together individuals who wish to buy or sell auto spare parts and car accessories. As such, we do not directly participate in the negotiation or financial transactions between buyers and sellers.
      </p>

      <h2>Platform Usage Fees</h2>
      <p>
        As a marketplace facilitator, we allow sellers to post their auto parts and accessories on our platform. While buyers can freely browse these listings, sellers are subject to platform usage fees to promote their listings, gain additional visibility, or feature products. 
      </p>
      <p>
        All charges for promotional packages, featured listings, or any other platform services are clearly outlined when a seller chooses to promote their listings. There are no hidden fees, and payment is required at the time of selecting these services.
      </p>

      <h2>Transactions Between Buyers and Sellers</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>e-autopartstore</strong> does not participate in the actual transactions between buyers and sellers. Once a buyer expresses interest in a part listed by a seller, they are provided with the seller's contact information. All negotiations, payments, and delivery terms are handled directly between the buyer and seller. We do not charge buyers for using the platform, nor do we collect any commissions from the sale of products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that <strong>e-autopartstore</strong> is not responsible for any disputes that may arise between the buyer and seller, including pricing, payment terms, delivery issues, or the condition of the products. It is essential that both parties communicate clearly and confirm all details before proceeding with a transaction.
      </p>

      <h2>Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
      <p>
        Sellers who purchase promotional services or featured listings are subject to our refund policy. Refunds are only available for promotional services that have not yet been activated. Once a service has been applied to a listing, no refunds will be provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buyers who wish to cancel a transaction must contact the seller directly. Since <strong>e-autopartstore</strong> is not involved in the transactions, we do not handle refunds or cancellations for any deals made between buyers and sellers.
      </p>

      <h2>Disputes & Liability</h2>
      <p>
        As a marketplace, <strong>e-autopartstore</strong> provides a platform for buyers and sellers to connect but assumes no responsibility for the quality, safety, or legality of the products listed, nor for the truth or accuracy of any listings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any disputes arising from a sale or purchase must be resolved directly between the buyer and seller. While we encourage users to resolve issues amicably, <strong>e-autopartstore</strong> will not mediate disputes or provide compensation for unsatisfactory transactions.
      </p>
